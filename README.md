>Hi there! I'm Sascha, proud parent of twin boys who are 4 and a half years old and have enough energy to power a small city. My days are filled with laughter, Lego battles, and occasionally refereeing sibling skirmishes.

>Our family also includes Arabella, our loyal (and vocal) dog, who we adopted as a puppy from a shelter in Spain. She’s a professional barker, especially when visitors or the postman show up.

>While I hold down the fort at home, my amazing wife works in a hospital, making a difference in people’s lives every day. Life with twins, a dog, and a medical superhero spouse is equal parts chaos and joy—but I wouldn’t trade it for the world!

**Merry Christmas**
